# Oslo

Oslo provides a bunch of auth utilities, including APIs for:

- Creating JWTs
- OAuth 2.0 clients
- Hashing passwords
- Generating cryptographically strong random values
- Signing and encoding data
- Verifying WebAuthn responses
- Zero dependencies (except for oslo/password)

It's lightweight, runtime agnostic, and fully typed.
