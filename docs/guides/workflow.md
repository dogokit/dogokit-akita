- Beginner-friendly documentation and learning resources.
- Links to ecosystem of packages and extensions.
- CLI tool for scaffolding and code generation.
- Built-in features for complex tasks such as queues, caching, etc.
- Develop equivalents for key missing features
- Ensure tight integration and excellent developer experience across all components
- Create comprehensive documentation and learning resources
- Build a strong community and ecosystem of packages and extensions
- Provide a unified, Laravel-like philosophy and approach to web development
