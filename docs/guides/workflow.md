# Workflow

Basic workflow of building a profitable software:

1. Understand the stack, tools, opinions, decisions, and architecture.
2. Setup development environment.
3. Run applications.
4. Test with real data and users.
5. Implement features.
6. Deploy to production.
7. Maintain, monitor, improve the app.
8. Promote, sell, increase visibility.
9. Run business with paying customers.

## Packages

Future expectations for JavaScript/TypeScript full stack frameworks to be truly comparable with Laravel, Rails, Django, Spring:

- Straightforward tutorials.
- Beginner-friendly learning resources.
- Comprehensive documentation.
- Predefined packages ready to use.
- Links to existing ecosystem of packages and extensions.
- CLI tool for scaffolding and code generation.
- Well-funded development.

For Dogokit (`dk`), if Animal objects or safari theme are being used, similar to [Laravel](../laravel.md) products and [RedwoodJS](../redwoodjs.md) CLI tools, these are the codenames.
