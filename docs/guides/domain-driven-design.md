# Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

Domain-Driven design (DDD) is a major software design approach, focusing on modeling software to match a domain according to input from that domain's experts.

DDD is like building a city, where each area (domain) has its own rules and purpose. Youâ€™ve got different areas: houses, parks, roads, and shops.

In software, DDD focuses on these domains, ensuring each one is well-understood and organized by consulting experts, making the program as well-structured.
