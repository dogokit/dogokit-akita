# oclif

oclif is an open source framework for building a command line interface (CLI) in Node.js and TypeScript.

Create CLIs with a few flags or advanced CLIs that have subcommands. oclif makes it easy for you to build CLIs for your company, service, or your own development needs.

```sh
$ npx oclif generate mynewcli
? npm package name (mynewcli): mynewcli

$ cd mynewcli

$ ./bin/run.js hello world
hello world! (./src/commands/hello/world.ts)
```
