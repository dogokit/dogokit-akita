## Welcome

If you are using TypeScript to build APIs or web apps above a SQL database, you are in the right place. ZenStack is an open-source toolkit built above Prisma - the most popular ORM for Node.js. ZenStack pushes Prisma's power to a new level and boosts the development efficiency of every layer of your stack - from access control to API development, and all the way up to the frontend.

Some of the most common use cases of ZenStack include:

- Multi-tenant SaaS

- CRUD-intensive API or web apps

ZenStack is not opinionated about your choice of framework. It can be used with any of them.
