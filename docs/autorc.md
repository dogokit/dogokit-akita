# autorc

`auto` is a tool designed to seamlessly automate the release workflow. It is powered by semantic version labels on pull requests. This approach does not require you to change your code or make any drastic changes to your current workflow.

While intended to run in a continuous integration (CI) environment, all auto commands can run locally as well.
